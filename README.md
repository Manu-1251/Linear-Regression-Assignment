# Linear-Regression-Assignment

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing service, has experienced a significant revenue dip due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover and prepare for post-pandemic demand, the company seeks to understand the factors influencing bike-sharing demand and how they contribute to demand prediction.

Using a dataset of daily bike demands based on various factors (e.g., weather, user behavior), the goal is to:

Identify significant variables affecting bike demand.
Build a multiple linear regression model to predict demand.
Help management strategize to meet demand and expand into new markets.
The model will enable BoomBikes to analyze demand dynamics, optimize business strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.
